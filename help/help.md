# About OpCut

**OpCut** stands for *optimal cut*, i.e. it optimizes the raw material selection and the way it is used to cover a specified set of lengths. The user can choose whether he/she wants to:
- minimize the overall cost of raw pieces,
- minimize the number pieces of visible cuts or joints of raw pieces combined into the lengths,
- to make a compromise between the two.

This tool enables to specify:
- lengths and cost of the raw material and
- lengths, that are to be covered/built.

The user is then provided with information on the number of each of the specified types of raw material he should purchase/use, how to cut each of those pieces and what of those cut pieces use to build each of the specified lengths. 

# Requirements
The tool is built for Windows 32-bit OS. 

# Installation
